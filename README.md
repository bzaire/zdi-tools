# Zeeman-Doppler Imaging tools (ZDI-tools)
## General tools coded in Python for handling spectropolarimetric data. Most of it is done for ZDI analysis, but plotting routines can be used for a general propose.

- Formated files are created with create_lsd routine. 
- Plotting routines are mostly dynamical maps for different purposes (specific lines, LSD profiles, plots with residuals, etc.)
  - Routines for plotting DR maps for either regular or non-regular grids are not currently available, but they can be provided under demand.
